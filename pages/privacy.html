  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    ScaffoldBot is an educational AI tool designed to support teachers with
    lesson scaffolding, especially for ELL/ESL learners. We respect your
    privacy and are committed to keeping your data safe.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    ScaffoldBot does not collect personal information such as names, emails, or
    student data. You should never enter sensitive or personally identifiable
    information into the tool.
  </p>

  <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>
    Prompts you enter are sent to OpenAI’s API in order to generate responses.
    These prompts and responses may be used by OpenAI for system monitoring and
    improvement. ScaffoldBot itself does not store or share your inputs.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Data</h2>
  <p>
    ScaffoldBot is intended for teacher use. It should not be used by students
    directly, and no student names or details should ever be entered.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    ScaffoldBot relies on OpenAI’s GPT technology. Please review
    <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use" target="_blank">OpenAI’s Terms of Use</a>
    and
    <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>
    for more information on how your data is processed.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    As an educator, you are responsible for ensuring that no personally
    identifiable student data is entered into the system. Always review AI
    outputs for accuracy and appropriateness before using them in class.
